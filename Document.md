## 1. Introduction

This page is used to inform app users and visitors about our policies regarding the ways we collect and use data. My name is Aart Hakkens, and I am the developer of the mobile game application Creepy Crawlies. This app is fully accessible as a free-to-play experience, without microtransactions. Any revenue is generated through advertisements, which is discussed in more detail below.

Although we do not exclusively target a specific age group, we believe that this game is suitable for players of all ages, including children. Because younger users may download and play Creepy Crawlies, we provide additional information on how we handle the data of children under 13 later in this policy. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all our users, especially minors who enjoy our game.

In addition, we have added a dedicated button in the app’s Settings menu that links directly to this Privacy Policy, ensuring that players and parents/guardians can easily access and review our practices at any time.

## 2. What Data We Collect

We collect the following information to operate and improve the game:

- **Name or Nickname**: Any display name that a player chooses to use.
- **Device Details**: The device type, model, name, and operating system on which the game is played.
- **Ad Metrics**: Impressions, clicks, ad revenue & currency code, and information about ads being opened, closed, or failing to load.
- **In-Game Progression**: Information related to your game progress, including gold, experience points, abilities unlocked, levels won/lost, last level played, and any stat point upgrades.

We do **not** collect real-world personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, **exact** age, mailing addresses, or passwords—this applies to all players, including children under 13. Any automatically collected device data (like IP addresses or device IDs) is handled through our integrated services (e.g., AdMob or Firebase) and is subject to those services’ privacy and data handling practices. We do not use this information to personally identify players.

## 3. How We Collect Data

We collect data from you and your device in the following ways:

1. **Direct Input:** When you (or your child) interact with our game, such as choosing a nickname or participating in certain game features.
2. **Automatic Collection:** Through integrated services like **Firebase** and **AdMob**, we automatically gather app usage data, such as the type of device used, operating system, and certain in-game behavior analytics.

For child users, we avoid asking for personal information whenever possible. We only collect what is strictly necessary to operate and improve our app or to comply with legal requirements.

## 4. Why We Collect Data (Purposes)

We collect data for the following purposes:

1. **App Functionality and Improvement:** To analyze gameplay and performance trends, diagnose technical issues, and enhance user experience.
2. **Analytics:** We use **Firebase** to track app usage metrics and understand how players interact with our game. This helps us optimize features and address any bugs.
3. **Advertising (If Applicable):** We use AdMob to display ads in our game. This may involve collecting certain non-personally identifiable device information to serve contextually relevant ads or limit the frequency of ads shown.

Where our app is directed to children, any data we collect is managed in a manner consistent with child privacy protections. We do not collect any more data than is necessary to provide core functions.

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share data with third-party providers, but only for the reasons described below:

1. **Service Providers:** We use Firebase and AdMob, both provided by Google, to help us operate, analyze, and improve our game. These providers may process limited data to perform tasks on our behalf.
2. **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose information if required by law or a valid legal process (e.g., court order), or if needed to protect our rights or user safety.
3. **Child Data Restrictions:** We do not sell or share children’s personal data with unrelated third parties for marketing purposes. Any sharing is strictly for valid operational needs.

## 6. Cookies and Similar Technologies

Our game may use technologies similar to cookies (e.g., local storage or device identifiers) to facilitate certain functions:

- **Firebase and AdMob:** These services may automatically gather device identifiers and usage data to provide analytics and serve ads.
- **Child-Specific Handling:** We do not employ tracking that identifies a child personally. Any data collected is used solely to run core analytics and advertising in a manner consistent with child privacy regulations.

Depending on your device or platform settings, you may be able to adjust preferences for tracking or data collection. Please note that restricting such data collection may affect certain functionalities of the game.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary to achieve the purposes outlined in this policy or to comply with legal obligations. Specifically:

- **Gameplay Data:** Stored for as long as it remains useful for analytics and improving user experience.
- **Firebase and AdMob Data:** Controlled largely by Google’s retention policies, but we configure the services with child protection settings where applicable.
- **Deletion Requests:** If you are a parent or guardian and you wish to review or delete your child’s data, please see “Parental Rights and Controls” below for instructions.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Our servers or service providers (including Firebase and AdMob) may be located in countries different from your own. If you choose to use our app:

- **Applicable Laws:** Your data may be transferred to and processed in jurisdictions that may have different data protection rules than your country.
- **Child-Centric Safeguards:** We apply the same level of protection for children’s data regardless of geographic location, in compliance with applicable regulations like COPPA (U.S.) or GDPR (EU).

## 9. Parental Rights and Controls

Parents and guardians play a crucial role in safeguarding children’s privacy:

1. **Access and Review:** You can request to see what information we hold about your child, if any.
2. **Deletion:** You can request that we delete any data we have collected from your child.
3. **Consent Withdrawal:** If you have previously given consent for data collection, you may revoke that consent at any time.
4. **Contact Us:** For any of these requests, please see our contact details in the “Contact Information” section. We will respond as quickly as possible, typically within 30 days.

## 10. Security Measures

We take the privacy and security of all users, especially children, very seriously:

- **Technical Safeguards:** We use encryption (where feasible), secure servers, and access controls to protect your data.
- **Monitoring and Reviews:** We periodically review our data practices and third-party integrations (including Firebase and AdMob) to ensure ongoing compliance with child privacy and security standards.

While we strive to maintain robust security measures, no system is entirely infallible. We will notify users/parents promptly if we learn of a data breach that compromises personal data.

## 11. Third-Party Links or Services

Our game may contain links or references to third-party services:

- **External Links:** If we link to external websites or apps, we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage parents to review the privacy policies of any external sites their children visit.
- **Third-Party SDKs:** In addition to Firebase and AdMob, we may use other third-party tools that collect non-personally identifiable data. We assess these integrations to ensure they align with child privacy requirements.

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to address evolving legal requirements or new features in our game:

- **Revision Notices:** If we make significant changes, we will notify users by updating this policy in-app or through other reasonable means.
- **Date of Last Update:** The “Effective Date” at the start of this document indicates the most recent changes.

We encourage parents and guardians to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our data practices and how we protect children’s information.

## 13. Contact Information

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our Privacy Policy or practices (including requests to access or delete your child’s data), please reach out to us (tech.latenight@gmail.com).

We are committed to responding as quickly as possible to address any concerns and ensure that we continue to protect the privacy of our users, especially children.
